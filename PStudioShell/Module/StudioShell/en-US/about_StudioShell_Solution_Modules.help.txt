    about_StudioShell_Solution_Modules

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell imports specific modules when a solution is loaded.  The
    modules are removed when the solution is closed.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Solution Modules provide an easy way to save StudioShell customizations
	with a particular solution.  For instance, if a solution uses the psake
	module to control its build process, the solution module could update
	the Visual Studio UI to invoke psake instead of MSBuild when any of the
	build commands are executed.
	
	A solution module can be a script module (.psm1 file) or module definition
	(.psd1 file) that:
	
	1. resides in the same directory as the solution (.sln) file.
	2. has the same name as the solution file, except for the extension.
	
	For example, if a solution file exists at:
	
		c:\code\mysolution.sln
		
	the solution module would be found at:
	
		c:\code\mysolution.psm1
		or
		c:\code\mysolution.psd1
		
	Solution modules are automatically imported after the solution is opened,
	and they are automatically removed as the solution is closed.  However, 
	you can override this behavior by modifying the StudioShell settings.
