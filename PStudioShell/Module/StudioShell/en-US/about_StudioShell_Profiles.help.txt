SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell supports your existing PowerShell profiles, as well as custom
    profiles specific to StudioShell.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	StudioShell recognizes your user PowerShell profile script.  For more 
	information about this standard profile script, type:
	
		get-help about_Profiles
		
	In addition, you can create profile scripts specific to StudioShell.  This
	allows you to save commonly used session customizations, such as functions, 
	import of PowerShell modules, etc, so they are applied each time you use
	StudioShell.
	
	StudioShell uses a single "All Users" profile script.  This script is 
	availabe at:
	
		<Installation Folder>\profile.ps1
		
	where <Installation Folder> is the location StudioShell is installed.
	
	Per-user profile scripts are available at:
	
		~\Documents\CodeOwlsLLC.StudioShell\profile.ps1
		
	where ~ represents the user's home directory.
	
	It is recommended that you create a user profile script instead of editing
	the "All Users" profile script, since the "All Users" profile script contains 
	script that is vital to certain StudioShell features.
	
CREATING YOUR STUDIOSHELL PROFILE SCRIPT

	To create a StudioShell profile script, type the following:
	
		new-item -path ~\Documents\CodeOwlsLLC.StudioShell\profile.ps1 -type file
