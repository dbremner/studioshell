SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell adds a custom PowerShell drive to your session.  This drive
    provides access to the extensibility features of Visual Studio.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Visual Studio exposes many internal features to developers for the purposes
	of extending the IDE to perform new tasks.  StudioShell exposes many of
	these features in the form of a "drive" in your PowerShell session.  This 
	drive allows you to manipulate the IDE, your projects and code, the 
	debugger, etc, treating all of these things as if they were a filesystem.
	
	The drive is named "dte" and is referred to in this documentation as the
	dte: drive.  The drive is exposed by a provider with the name "PSDTE".
	
	You can use the dte: drive just like any other drive in your PowerShell 
	session.  For instance, the following script gets a list of all projects
	in the currently-loaded solution:
	
		ls dte:/solution/projects	

	For details on the contents of the dte: drive, type:
		
		get-help PSDTE
		
ADDITIONAL DRIVES

	The default StudioShell profile defines several drives at specific 
	locations in the dte: drive for convenience.
	
	For a complete list of these drives, type:
	
		get-psdrive -psprovider psdte
